  \frametitle{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extend class for analytic functions to multi dimensional case
    \item Solver for ODEs with analytic right hand sides
    \item Detailed Analysis of Numerical ODE solvers
	\item Parametrized analysis of such approaches will be performed
	\item taking into account the number of steps and the intermediate precision required to attain guaranteed
output error $2^{-n}$
\end{itemize}
